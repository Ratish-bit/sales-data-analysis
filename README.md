📊 Sales Data Analysis & Automated Reporting
🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes $8M+ retail transaction data to uncover revenue trends, customer behavior, and business growth patterns.

Using SQL and Python, I built an automated reporting pipeline and interactive dashboards that identified 65% Year-over-Year (YoY) revenue growth and improved executive reporting efficiency.

🎯 Business Problem

The organization had large volumes of raw retail transaction data but:

No structured KPI tracking

No automated reporting

Limited visibility into revenue trends

Manual and time-consuming executive reports

The goal was to transform raw data into actionable business insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)

Power BI / Tableau (Optional)

Jupyter Notebook

Excel

🔍 Data Description

120,000+ retail transactions

$8M+ total revenue

Multiple product categories

Customer-level purchase records

Multi-year time-series data

Customer ID

Region

📈 Key KPIs Analyzed

Total Revenue

Year-over-Year Growth

Monthly Sales Trends

Category Performance

Customer Purchase Behavior

Average Order Value (AOV)

📊 YoY Growth Formula
YoY Growth (%) = ((Revenue_current_year - Revenue_previous_year) 
                   / Revenue_previous_year) * 100

SQL was used to aggregate yearly revenue, and Python was used for growth computation and visualization.
